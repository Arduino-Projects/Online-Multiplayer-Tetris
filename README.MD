# Online Multiplayer Tetris
A multi-player online tetris game to play with friends!


# Why I Made This
One of my favorite games in highschool was tetris friends, a multiplayer tetris game which I played with my friends. But eventually, tetris friends released a notice that since their game was run on Adobe Flash, they would have to shut down their website as Flash Web Support was about to come to an end. That's why I took it upon myself to make a clone!


# How Does It Work
- Running Javascript with custom made code for all the game physics and mechanics
- Whenever player clears a line, a solid line is sent to their opponent at the bottom of their stack
- The objective of the game is to stay alive longer than your opponent
- When your stack of blocks reaches the top of the grid, you die!
- Firebase RT Database is constantly being updated with the grid, so grid updates are near instant


# Obstacles/Challenges
- From the game physics to the database reading and writing, this was definitely one of my more complicated projects!
- Took about 1-2 weeks to complete
- A LOT of error checking and database correcting
